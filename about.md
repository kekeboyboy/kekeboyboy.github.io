<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/profile.png" height="80" width="100"> A British gentleman currently based in Taipei, Taiwan working for a tech startup. Developing in Swift for iOS is my day job and I also enjoy fooling around with Python/Flask. This blog is powered by Jekyll and hosted (with :heart: of course) on Github Pages.
